# Usage:
1. Make sure matplotlib is installed on your computer (`pip3 install matplotlib`)
2. Invoke the program with `python3.7 gui.py`

# Known issues:
* Going from a=5 to b=0 (aka backwards) will get the right answer but the x axis will be flipped
* Doing the above w/ a sqrt (or something else that is invalid)
* The equations have to be written with a lot of parenthesis+operators (ex `1.5 * (x ^ 2)` instead of `1.5x^2`)
